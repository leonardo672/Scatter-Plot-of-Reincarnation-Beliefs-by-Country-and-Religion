# Scatter-Plot-of-Reincarnation-Beliefs-by-Country-and-Religion

### This code is designed to analyze and visualize data from a psychological-philosophical study on reincarnation beliefs that I personally conducted. It processes survey data to create a scatter plot that illustrates the relationship between country names, religious backgrounds, and reincarnation belief survey results.
